# Titanic Data Science Project

## Description
This repository contains a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python. The project covers data cleaning, transformation, statistical computation, and visualization. It is designed as a beginner-friendly but systematic walkthrough of essential data science operations.

## Features
The project performs the following:

- Imports all required Python libraries  
- Reads and loads the Titanic dataset  
- Renames columns to standardized labels: **Name, Survived, Gender, Age, Class**  
- Computes the total number of rows  
- Displays the first 15 and last 20 rows  
- Calculates:  
  - Average passenger age  
  - Oldest passenger and their name  
  - Youngest survivor and their name  
- Performs grouping by:  
  - Passenger Class  
  - Survival status  
- Computes:  
  - Total survivors  
  - Average age of 2nd-class passengers  
  - Number of survivors in 3rd class  
  - Average age of passengers who died from 1st class  
- Creates visualizations:  
  - Pie chart of passenger distribution by class  
  - Histogram of age distribution
